== HW04 Hints ==

 - You can read a line from standard input with "fgets(buf, max, stdin)"
   see: man 3 fgets
 - You can allocate your input buffer as an array on the stack. No test string will be longer
   than 80 characters.
 - You can sort with the "qsort" library function.
   see: man 3 qsort
 - You can compare two strings with "strcmp"
   see: man 3 strcmp
 - You'll need to write a wrapper function around strcmp to make the types match,
   since strcmp works with strings and qsort expects void*'s.

== Static Analysis ==

clang-check -analyze *.c --
valgrind --leak-check=yes -q ./sort-strings < input

== HW04x Hints ==

 - I recommend building a dynamic array data structure (struct, functions) to store strings.

 - End of file can be detected with feof(stdin)
   man feof
